# Libs-Build

Some of my projects have complicated dependencies. 

This script will automatically bulid the dependencies.

As of 2016/19/25, it works with the Trade-Frame project:

```
build.sh tradeframe
```

This script requires bash, and is tested on Debian Stretch x64.

libraries are installed into /usr/local/lib and includes are placed in /usr/local/include.
